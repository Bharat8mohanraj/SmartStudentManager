## Overview
Student Performance Tracker is a professional-grade Python CLI tool to manage, analyze, and rank student academic records across multiple streams like Maths+CS, Commerce, Biology, and Humanities.  
This project leverages **Pandas** and **NumPy** for powerful CSV data handling and fast computations, making it easy for educators or admins to track grades, ranks, toppers, and perform updates â€” all in a user-friendly menu-driven interface.

## Features
- Add new students with marks across multiple subjects  
- Auto-calculate total, average, percentage & grade  
- Rank students based on total marks  
- Display subject-wise toppers  
- Update or modify student data interactively  
- Delete student records safely  
- Separate data files for different academic streams  
- Error handling & input validation for smooth experience

## Why This Project?
Handling student records manually is tedious and error-prone. This tool brings automation, accuracy, and instant insights to academic data management without any complex UI or database. Perfect for small institutions or tutors.
